<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the last decade of Peter Cooper's
life, the writer of this biographical sketch
enjoyed some degree of intimacy with him,
as professional adviser and traveling companion,
and also, incidentally, as consulting
engineer of the firm of Cooper and Hewitt,
and manager of a department in the Cooper
Union. This circumstance, together with
the preference kindly expressed by Mr.
Cooper's family, doubtless influenced the selection
of the writer for the honorable task
of preparing this book,&mdash;a task which was
welcome as a labor of love, though the execution
of it has been hindered and impaired
by the demands of other duties. The real
difficulty has been to compress within the
prescribed limits a story covering so many
years and so many topics, yet not possessing
those features of dramatic action or adventure
which could be treated briefly, with
picturesque effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cooper's family has kindly furnished
abundant material for this work, including,
besides his own published utterances, the
notes of the stenographer to whom Mr.
Cooper, in the last years of his life, dictated
his "reminiscences." The use which has
been made of these will be evident to the
reader. Beyond an occasional revelation of
the character of the speaker, or a side-light
thrown upon the manners and conditions of
our early national life, they have not furnished
valuable data; and the study of
them suggests an observation which may be
heeded with advantage in similar cases hereafter,
though it comes too late to be useful in
this instance, namely, that the recollections
of old people with retentive memories, like
Peter Cooper, may be invaluable, if they
are intelligently aroused and guided; but if
the speakers (as in his case) are left to their
own initiative, they are too likely to furnish
superfluous accounts of events already described
more accurately in authentic contemporaneous
records.</p>

<p>It has not been practicable to preserve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
in the treatment of the subject, a strictly
chronological order. As the titles of the
several chapters indicate, the different lines
of Mr. Cooper's activity have been considered,
to some extent, separately, so that
their periods overlap each other.</p>

<p>This sketch of Mr. Cooper's career furnishes
the elements of an analysis, which I
introduce here, as a guide in the interpretation
of what is to follow.</p>

<p>1. The time of his birth and the prophetic
anticipations of his parents profoundly
influenced his ambition to do something
great for his fellow-citizens of the
republic whose life began so nearly with
his own.</p>

<p>2. The atmosphere surrounding his youth
was one of unlimited and audacious adventure.
New institutions, a virgin continent,
the ardent desire to be independent of the
Old World, and a profound belief in the
destiny of America, all combined to stimulate
endeavor. What Peter Cooper said of
himself as an apprentice was true of the typical
young American of his time: "I was always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
planning and contriving, and was never
satisfied unless I was doing something difficult&mdash;something
that had never been done
before, if possible."</p>

<p>3. The new freedom and the vast opportunity
presented in the young republic encouraged,
to a degree not paralleled before
or since, that change of occupation which,
with all its drawbacks, had the one great
merit that it educated men to various activities.
It was no disgrace to an American
to go into one business after another, seeking
the one which would prove most profitable
and agreeable. Thus, Peter Cooper
worked successively as a hatter, a coach-builder,
a machinist, a machine-maker, a
grocer, an iron-worker, and a glue-manufacturer,
achieving success in every occupation,
but abandoning each for something more
promising, and learning in each something
which promoted his success in the next.</p>

<p>4. At every stage of his progress, he followed
the ideal of personal independence,
the honest acquisition of property, the establishment
of a home, and the rearing of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
family. These were the first duties and the
dearest wishes&mdash;no matter what greater
things might lie beyond. And he profoundly
realized that temperance, industry,
frugality, and patience were the necessary
preliminaries to any longed-for achievement.
As he says, he had first to spend thirty
years in getting a start; then to spend another
thirty years in accumulating the means
for further advance into the wider sphere of
his aspirations. And during each stage of
this process, he was patient, as well as hopeful,
neither wasting his energies in visionary
schemes nor allowing the eddies of daily
toil to divert the current of his deeper purposes.</p>

<p>5. At every stage, however, he found
himself hindered by lack of thorough knowledge.
He invented perpetually and profusely;
but some of his most cherished inventions
did not find practical recognition,
because he had attempted the premature or
the impossible. His guiding principle, of
trying to do something that had never been
done before, is not an adequate substitute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
for a scientific knowledge of what can be,
and now needs to be, done. He found himself
often too far in advance of his generation.
Moreover, he found that the lack of
education crippled him in the attempt to
make other men understand and appreciate
his fruitful ideas. This is true of all really
great "self-made men." They may have
achieved success and fame in spite of early
disadvantages; they may, perhaps, recognize
the fact that such disadvantages, necessitating
a stern struggle, have sifted out,
by natural selection, the possessors of genius
and sterling character; but not one of them
fails to lament the lack of that early training
which would have made him still more successful
than he is; and not one of them
fails to desire, for his children and the coming
generation of his fellows, the early advantages
which were denied to himself.</p>

<p>6. This experience it was which gave
form to the aspirations and purposes of
Peter Cooper. As an apprentice, he resolved
to do something for the benefit of
apprentices&mdash;to found some institution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
which should supplement the deficiencies of
early education, furnishing to virtuous, industrious,
and ambitious youths the means
of progress, and attracting the thoughtless
or indolent into the same ascending road.
How this conception came to be both modified
and realized will be seen in later pages.
At this point it is sufficient to note that
the plan was originally not only philanthropic,
but patriotic and practical. It contemplated
the benefit, through means adapted
to their special condition, of Americans of
that class to which Peter Cooper himself belonged.</p>

<p>Some further observations concerning the
secret of the universal esteem and affection
enjoyed by Mr. Cooper will be reserved for
the closing chapter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h3>ANCESTRY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Obadiah Cooper</span>, who, with his two
brothers, came from England to the colony
of New York about 1662, belonged, as we
may infer with confidence, to that sturdy
class of republican yeomanry which found
the restored reign of the Stuarts intolerable.
He settled at Fishkill-on-the-Hudson; and
his son Obadiah&mdash;whom tradition declares
to have been the fourth white man child
born in what is now Dutchess County&mdash;was
the great-grandfather of Peter Cooper. In
1720 an Obadiah of the next generation
followed, and of his son John, born in 1755,
Peter Cooper was the fifth child.</p>

<p>John Cooper came of age in the year of
the Declaration of Independence. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
issue between the British government and
the American colonies his choice could not
be doubtful. He followed the traditions of
his family. Indeed, it is now well established
and universally admitted that the
patriots of the American Revolution were
not in fact arrayed against England. They
were engaged in a struggle which was but a
part of the great conflict waged against shortsighted
and obstinate tyranny by Englishmen
on both sides of the ocean, and in which
the victory for liberty was won on this
side sooner than on the other. What the
Coopers and their kind achieved here was
applauded openly in the mother country by
the descendants of a common ancestry as a
triumph for the common cause. The use of
foreign mercenaries under British commanders
in this country was the direct result of
the impossibility of inducing Englishmen to
enlist for service against their American
kinsmen. Hence when John Cooper, of
Fishkill, abandoned in 1776 the business he
had just established as a hatter, and became
sergeant in a company of "minute-men," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was but pursuing the course indicated both
by his own convictions and by the history of
his fathers and the sympathies of the party
in England to which they had belonged. It
was Freedom's battle "handed down from
sire to son."</p>

<p>He served subsequently for two years in
the Continental line, and for the last four
years of the war as a lieutenant in the
New York militia, actively employed in the
perilous service of protecting life, property,
and the public stores in the zone of debatable
territory,&mdash;the "bloody ground"
which surrounded the British lines in New
York. At the close of the war, New York
having been evacuated by the enemy, Lieutenant
John Cooper retired to civil life, and
resumed business as a hatter in that city,&mdash;a
worthy example of that American citizen
soldiery which has always been equally ready
to leave the ways of peace for its country's
defense, and to return to them when the
exigency had passed.</p>

<p>It was in 1779, during his military service,
that John Cooper married Margaret, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
daughter of John Campbell, a deputy quartermaster-general
in the Continental army, and a
trusted agent of Washington. The outbreak
of hostilities in 1776 had found John Campbell
a prosperous merchant and owner of
real estate in New York city. He at once
lent to the Revolutionary government eleven
hundred guineas,&mdash;the whole of his ready
money,&mdash;entered the service, was made
deputy quartermaster-general, and was directed
to superintend the hasty evacuation
of the city by the Whig inhabitants, and to
protect them and their property as far as
possible. Lingering too long to assist some
of the laggards, he was captured by the forces
landed from the British fleet, but was subsequently
released; and he made a temporary
home at Fishkill while actively engaged in
establishing the lines by which the British
army, though holding the city and commanding
its access to the sea, was practically besieged.
General Campbell served throughout
the war, and after hostilities had ceased
commanded the troops at West Point until
they were finally disbanded in 1785.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy to imagine how the young lieutenant
and the daughter of the commander
who must have been frequently brought into
personal relations with him may have met
and loved and wedded in the midst of those
troublous times, but the romance would have
no special bearing on this history. It is
enough to say that by this marriage the best
blood of England and Scotland&mdash;of servants
of God and lovers of freedom&mdash;was
blended in the nine children, seven sons
and two daughters, of whom Peter Cooper&mdash;born
February 12, 1791, in Little Dock
(now Water) Street, New York&mdash;was the
fifth.</p>

<p>John Cooper was not characteristically a
seer of visions or a dreamer of dreams. On
the contrary, the accounts of him which
have come down to us describe him as a
stalwart athlete, who "could lift a barrel
of cider from the ground and put it in a
wagon," and who once, being cornered and
attacked by a bull, seized the animal's nose
with one hand and so battered its head with
a stone that it was glad to turn and fly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Yet he came of a race that believed in Divine
guidance; and on one occasion at least
he acted upon that belief in a matter then
deemed more important, perhaps, than now.
The incident can be given best in the words
of Peter Cooper himself, who wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father used to tell me how he came
to call me Peter. When I was born he became
strongly impressed with the idea that
I would some day have more than ordinary
fame, and what name he should give me was
a matter of serious and frequent thought.
While walking on Broadway one dark night
it seemed as though a voice spoke to him in
a clear and distinct manner: 'Call him
Peter!' That seeming voice settled my
name. My father said that he felt that I
was to be of great good in some way; and
his remarks, with my mother's, concerning
their aspirations and hopes for me acted as a
stimulus and made me anxious to fulfill their
wishes, and not disappoint them."</p>

<p>If names were to be characteristic of individual
careers, it might be better to imitate
some Indian tribes, and to give the permanent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
name only after the career, or at
least the character, of its recipient had been
indicated by his acts. In this instance the
subsequent life of the son did not in any
peculiar way imitate that of the Apostle
Peter. Evidently not that particular name,
but the simple fact that an eminent name,
thus suggested and not already familiar in his
family, had been given to him, produced
upon his mind the effect to which he testifies.</p>

<p>But why should practical John Cooper
be disposed to anticipate a special distinction
for the infant who was the fifth of his
numerous progeny? From the standpoint
of the modes of thought of the godly patriots
of that generation, and of their ancestors,
the English Puritans and the Scotch Covenanters,
it is scarcely hazardous to assume
that current public affairs largely affected
such domestic choices. Peter Cooper's birth
was practically simultaneous with the launching
of that Ship of State, the "Union, strong
and great," in which all patriots had embarked
"their hopes, triumphant o'er their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fears." To his veteran-soldier father he
was the first child of the new era; and the
dreams that were dreamed over him were
doubtless connected with that glorious future
which had just dawned upon the federated
republic. The choice of an unfamiliar, non-hereditary
name, however suggested, symbolized
the break between the old time and
the new.</p>

<p>Above all, this incident produced in the
son thus christened the profoundest effects,
the deepest motives, that can inspire a boyish
soul,&mdash;the belief in a beneficent mission,
the yearning to discover it, the resolve to
execute it, and the conviction that it was to
be directly connected with the prosperity
and progress of the great nation, the life of
which began with his own.</p>

<p>The naming of Peter Cooper thus strikes
the keynote, or, more accurately, the triple
chord, of his life. For he was first of all an
American, keenly aware of the opportunities
offered by the free institutions of his country
to individual ambition, industry, and
genius, and of his own personal ability to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
make use of these opportunities. Secondly,
he was a lover of his fellow men, determined
to employ for their benefit the means
and powers which he felt himself able to
accumulate by thought, toil, and frugal economy.
Thirdly, he was even in his philanthropy
essentially still an American, intent
most of all upon the welfare of those classes
of his countrymen with whose struggles and
needs his own early life had made him familiar.
In other words, while his philanthropy
covered a world-wide range, his peculiar mission,
as he conceived it, was indissolubly blent
with the success of the republic of which he
was one of the earliest-born sons.</p>

<h3>BOYHOOD AND YOUTH</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a meeting of friends, gathered February
12, 1882, to celebrate his ninety-first birthday
anniversary, Mr. Cooper, after expressing
his thanks for their congratulatory good
wishes, and observing that in his case "length
of days had not yet resulted in weariness of
spirit," added this review of his life:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Looking back, I can see that my career
has been divided into three eras. During
the first thirty years I was engaged in getting
a start in life; during the second thirty
years I was occupied in getting means for
carrying out the modest plan which I had
long formed for the benefit of my fellow
men; and during the last thirty years I have
devoted myself to the execution of these
plans. This work is now done."</p>

<p>Accepting this division of his career, as
convenient, though not strictly accurate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
(since the processes described really overlapped
instead of separately succeeding one
another), we may consider first Mr. Cooper's
means and method of achieving personal
success; and in this survey the conditions of
his boyhood and early youth are primarily
important.</p>

<p>While he was still very young, the family
removed from a temporary residence of three
years in New York city to Peekskill, where
he remained until, at the age of seventeen,
he returned to New York as an apprentice,
to be, thenceforward, dependent upon his
own exertions for a living.</p>

<p>The intervening period was spent in ways
characteristic of the period and of the individual.
He attended school for three or
four "quarters," of which period, according
to his later recollection, "probably half was
occupied by 'half-day' school." Outside of
this scanty formal instruction, there is
ample evidence that he developed body and
mind in varied work and play. He bore to
the end of life the scars of youthful escapades,
witnessing the adventurous spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his boyhood. When only four years old,
he climbed about the framework of a new
house, and fell, head downward, upon an
iron kettle, cutting his forehead to the bone.
Later on, he was accidentally cut with a knife
in the hands of a playmate. Later still, he
cut himself dangerously with an axe. Again,
he fell from a high tree, holding an iron
hook with which he had been reaching for
cherry-bearing branches, and managed to
hook out one of his teeth. At another time
he went for the nest of a hanging-bird, and
had the fact that it was a hornet's nest indelibly
impressed on his memory. Of course,
he was nearly drowned three times,&mdash;such
youngsters always have such escapes. In
short, he was a thorough boy, adventuring
all things, daunted by nothing, and protected
from the results of his reckless endeavors
by that Providence which watches
over small boys.</p>

<p>But such a temperament finds play in
useful work also. The boy learned every
department of the hat-making business, beginning,
when he was very young, with pulling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the fur from the skins of rabbits. And,
while assisting his mother in doing the
family washing, he made what was, perhaps,
his first invention,&mdash;a mechanical arrangement
for pounding the soiled linen. Again,
after carefully dissecting an old shoe, to learn
how it was put together, he determined to
make shoes and slippers for the family, and
succeeded in turning out products of manufacture
which were said to be as good as
those to be found, at that day, in the regular
trade.</p>

<p>He constructed a toy wagon, sold it for
six dollars, managed to gather four dollars
more, invested the ten dollars in lottery
tickets, and drew only blanks, of which experience
he said many years later, "I consider
it one of the best investments of my life; for
I then learned that it was not my <i>forte</i> to
make money at games of chance."</p>

<p>When he was between thirteen and fourteen
years old, his father built a large malt-house
at Newburg, and the son loaded with
his own hands and carted to the site selected
all the stone for the building. Collecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wild honey and shooting game in the forests
around Peekskill were additional employments
which combined pleasure with profit.
But this life did not satisfy the ambition of
the youth; and in 1808, at the age of seventeen,
he left the paternal roof and apprenticed
himself for four years to John Woodward,
a leading coach-builder in New York,
whose shop was located on the corner of
Broadway and Chambers Street, then the
northerly edge of the city, opposite a vegetable
garden, the remnants of which, after
the occupation of a large portion by city,
county, and national buildings, now constitute
the City Hall Park. The terms of his
employment were his board and a salary of
twenty-five dollars a year,&mdash;out of which he
managed not only to pay all obligations, but
also to lay by a little money. During this
period he not only mastered the details of
the trade, but learned in his hours of leisure
other branches, such as ornamental wood-carving,
and made several inventions, one of
which was a machine for mortising hubs,&mdash;an
operation performed by hand up to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
time. Another invention over which the
young apprentice dreamed, and of which he
laboriously constructed a model, was an apparatus
for utilizing, in the running of machinery,
the swift current of the tide in the
East River.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<h2>III</h2>

<h3>BUSINESS VENTURES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of his apprenticeship, his employer
offered to set him up in business as
a coach-builder, lending him the necessary
capital. Many years later, Mr. Cooper told
the story thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was about to accept his generous offer,
when an incident occurred which changed
my decision. Mr. Woodward had just completed
one of the finest coaches ever built in
New York, for a gentleman who was supposed
to be one of the richest men in the
city. But a day or two before the coach
was to be delivered the gentleman died, and
it was then found that he was insolvent.
This made me hesitate. If I should accept
my employer's kind offer and have such a
misfortune happen to me in the sale of an
elegant and expensive coach, I should consider
myself a slave for life, since the law of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
imprisonment for debt had not then been
abolished. So I changed my plans, and
went to Hempstead, Long Island, to visit my
brother."</p>

<p>The visit to Hempstead became a prolonged
residence. He obtained work at
$1.50 a day (then regarded as high wages)
in a factory making machines for shearing
cloth, and after nearly three years had
saved enough money to purchase the right
for the State of New York to a patented
machine for that purpose. He used to tell,
in his old age, of his elation when he effected
his first sale of a county-right, for which he
received five hundred dollars from Mr. Vassar,
of Poughkeepsie, afterwards the founder
of Vassar College.</p>

<p>The manufacture and sale of the new
shearing-machine, into which Mr. Cooper
introduced many additional improvements,
was a prosperous business, especially during
the war of 1812, when domestic woolen
goods were in great demand. He married,
December 18, 1813, Sarah Bedell, a lady of
Huguenot descent, who made for him a happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
home during fifty-seven years.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He bought
a house in Hempstead, expecting to remain
there; and in the household, as in business,
he gave rein to his ardent and versatile inventive
faculty. One of his domestic contrivances
rocked the cradle, fanned away
the flies, and played a lullaby to the baby.
He sold the patent in Connecticut to a
Yankee peddler for a horse and wagon, and
the peddler's stock, including a hurdy-gurdy.
Another invention was a machine for mowing
grass, constructed on the principle of his
cloth-shearing machine.</p>

<p>But after the war, the domestic woolen
mills were shut down, and there was no sale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for Mr. Cooper's machines. So he first
turned his factory into a furniture shop, and
then, selling it for what he could get, he
moved to New York, and started in the
grocery business, buying for this purpose a
long lease of the ground where the Bible
House now stands, opposite the Cooper
Union on Ninth Street. Upon this ground
he erected several buildings, one of which
he used as his office. The business was
profitable; but the real foundation of Mr.
Cooper's wealth was laid when, at the age
of thirty-three, he purchased a glue factory,
situated where the Park Avenue Hotel now
stands, and established himself as a glue
manufacturer. The business speedily acquired
and held for half a century practically
the whole trade of the country in glue
and isinglass,&mdash;a monopoly fairly earned by
the cheapness and excellence of its product.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper's inventions improved the
quality and reduced the cost of his product,
while his energy, industry, and frugality
steadily increased his surplus cash, and enabled
him, without borrowing capital, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
extend his sphere of operations. For many
years, he carried on his glue business without
bookkeeper, agent, or salesman. Dawn
found him at the suburban factory (on what is
now Thirty-Second Street) lighting the fires
and preparing for the day's work; at noon,
he drove in his buggy to the city, where he
made his own sales and purchases; and all
his evenings he spent at home, making up
his accounts, answering his correspondents,
studying out new inventions, or talking and
reading to his wife and children.</p>

<p>By these simple, old-fashioned methods he
built up a business and accumulated a fortune
too large to be thus administered. It would
have been impossible for one head to carry the
details of work and management, for one pair
of eyes to superintend each part of the work,
or for one pair of feet, however tireless, to
travel all the ways which lead to and from a
great modern industrial establishment. Still
less could financial direction and protection be
compassed by the simple scheme which Mr.
Cooper, in his old age, recalled with pride.
"I used," he said once, "to pay all my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
debts every Saturday night; and I knew
that what I had left was my own!" This
could not have been strictly true; but it
doubtless expressed an old man's memory of
the way he began, and the principles he had
followed, with that horror of debt which
dated from the time when debtors could be
put in jail. Fortunately for Mr. Cooper, his
son Edward, and his son-in-law, Abram S.
Hewitt, were at hand to undertake the management
of his business enterprises at the
time when his own simple methods would
have proved inadequate, so that his inventive
genius, adventurous courage, and, above
all, intense philanthropy, were backed with
ample means.</p>

<p>In this account of his business ventures
(though of much later date than those already
mentioned) the part played by Peter
Cooper in the development of the American
iron industry and in the construction of the
first transatlantic submarine telegraph may
be recorded.</p>

<p>The manufacture of iron was one of the
early industries of the American colonies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and after the Revolution it was prosecuted
with increased activity in small and primitive
establishments. With its development
into scientific forms on a large scale Mr.
Cooper was both directly and indirectly connected.
His Ringwood estate in New Jersey
had been the scene of the operations of the
Ringwood Company in 1740, and of its successors,&mdash;Hasenclever
(1764) and Erskine
(1771); and the Durham furnace, on the
Delaware River in Pennsylvania (on the site
of the Durham Iron Works of Cooper &amp;
Hewitt), made its first blast in 1727. Mr.
Cooper himself was engaged in 1830 in the
manufacture of charcoal iron near Baltimore,
and in 1836, together with his brother
Thomas, he operated a rolling-mill in New
York (on Thirty-Third Street, near Third
Avenue). At this mill anthracite was used
for puddling in 1840. In 1845 the business
was removed to Trenton, N. J.; and in
the new rolling-mill&mdash;then the largest in
the United States&mdash;built at Trenton for
the manufacture of rails, the first iron beams
for buildings were rolled in 1854. By the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
erection of blast furnaces at Phillipsburg
and Ringwood, N. J., and Durham, Pa., and
the addition of wire mills, bridge shop, chain
shop, etc., to the works at Trenton, the purchase
of iron and coal lands, and the development
of numerous mines, the firm of Cooper
&amp; Hewitt achieved high rank among the
ironmasters of America; and the Iron and
Steel Institute of Great Britain conferred
upon Peter Cooper in 1879 the "Bessemer
gold medal" for his services in the development
of the American iron trade. In 1890
the same honor was given to Mr. Abram S.
Hewitt in recognition of the experiments at
Phillipsburg as early as 1856 to test the
new invention of Bessemer, of his introduction
of the open-hearth steel process into the
United States, and of other services rendered
to the steel industry,&mdash;in all of which he
may be said to have followed, with the advantages
of a wider culture and ampler
means, the example set by Mr. Cooper.</p>

<p>One of the boldest yet wisest and most
profitable operations of Mr. Cooper was his
investment in the Atlantic cable enterprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of Cyrus Field. He was already past middle
age when this audacious scheme began
to be dreamed of. In 1842 Morse had laid
down an experimental cable from Castle
Garden to Governor's Island in New York
harbor, and claimed as a practical inference
that a telegraphic communication on his
plan could "with certainty be established
across the Atlantic."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In 1851 the first
cable was laid between France and England,
and others rapidly followed on ocean lines
over short distances. The principle was
thus established, and the doubts as to its
practical application to a line of at least
twenty-five hundred miles were of such a
character as to seem more serious to scientific
men than to American capitalists of Mr.
Cooper's type. In March, 1854, the New
York, Newfoundland, &amp; London Telegraph
Company was organized, and Mr. Cooper
became (and remained for twenty trying
years) its president. There was little difficulty
in raising the money for the eighty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
miles of cable which were to be laid
under the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or in obtaining
from the British colonies favorable
charters granting exclusive privileges, land
grants, and even subsidies. Yet the construction
of the land line across Newfoundland
to the terminus at Heart's Content
proved difficult and costly, and the St. Lawrence
cable was lost in laying. Yet additional
capital was subscribed; and a couple
of years later the Newfoundland line, the
St. Lawrence cable, and another submarine
link of thirteen miles across the Straits of
Northumberland had been successfully finished.
Nothing remained to be done <i>except</i>
the procuring of means and the devising of
successful methods for the installation of the
Atlantic cable itself, without which all this
preliminary expenditure would have been
thrown away.</p>

<p>The capital estimated as necessary for
making and laying the cable was raised by
Mr. Field in England, where the Atlantic
Telegraph Company was formed to construct
and operate the line under concessions from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the parent Newfoundland company. All
classes in England felt a sentimental interest
in the romantic enterprise; and the
subscribers to the new stock included such
men as Thackeray and others of equal note,
outside of business circles altogether.</p>

<p>The company proceeded with vigor,&mdash;secured
from the governments of Great Britain
and the United States guaranties of
subsidies and the free use of ships for laying
the cable; contracts for the cable and its insulating
covering were executed; and by the
end of July, 1857, the British Agamemnon
and the American Niagara had each twelve
hundred and fifty miles of it on board.
In August they connected the two halves of
it in mid-Atlantic, and in September the
shore end was landed at Heart's Content.</p>

<p>The sequel is familiar history. A few
messages had been sent and received, when
the current grew weaker and weaker, and at
last failed entirely. The result was a strong
reaction in popular sentiment. It was even
questioned whether any messages had actually
crossed the Atlantic. Fortunately this doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
could be conclusively disproved,&mdash;especially
in England, where it was known that the
British government had wired by the cable
before its failure news of great political importance.
The British company indeed courageously
proceeded to make another cable;
but when this parted in mid-ocean during
the process of laying it even British tenacity
of purpose was daunted, and for some two
years the enterprise seemed to be dead.
Meanwhile public opinion on this side was
far more unfavorable, and the parent company
found itself without means or credit.
To retain its privileges it must pay additional
money, and to make those privileges
worth anything capital must be raised for
a third attempt to lay the transatlantic
line.</p>

<p>Without describing in detail the difficulties
and anxieties of this period, it may be
said that the intelligent courage of Peter
Cooper saved the enterprise, while it secured
to him a large pecuniary reward; for he
perceived that the real problem had been
solved by the first apparent failure; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the failure of a cable in use or the loss of a
cable in laying it were mere incidental misfortunes
which more thorough precautions
and better luck would preclude; and he
backed with his own faith and money the
undaunted enthusiasm and persuasive eloquence
of Mr. Field, whose expenses he paid
for another journey to England, and who
succeeded at last in raising there the funds
for the third and successful attempt. Moreover
Mr. Cooper upheld the credit of the
Newfoundland company, personally paying
the drafts drawn upon it, and taking its
bonds as his security. It is too much to say
that the Atlantic cable would never have
been laid, but there can be no doubt that
the enterprise would have been long suspended,
without this timely aid. The third
cable was a success; the lost second was recovered
and made useful; and now the thing
is easy which thus seemed so problematical.
If Peter Cooper received in the end a handsome
sum from this investment, who could
grudge him the wealth so acquired?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>INVENTIONS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inventions projected, though in many
instances not perfected or successfully introduced,
by Mr. Cooper constitute a long list
and cover a wide field. A few of them may
be mentioned here, in addition to those to
which allusion has been made already. It
will be seen that even those which failed of
commercial success generally contained the
germs of future mechanical progress, and
bore witness to the extraordinary vigor and
versatility of his genius.</p>

<p>When the Erie Canal was approaching
completion it occurred to Mr. Cooper that
canal boats might be propelled by the power
of water drawn from a higher level and
moving a series of endless chains along the
canal. After some preliminary experiments
he built a flat-bottomed scow, arranged a
water wheel to utilize the tidal current in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the East River, and actually achieved a trial
trip of two miles and return, in which Governor
Clinton and other invited guests took
part. The governor was so well pleased
that he paid Mr. Cooper eight hundred dollars
for the first chance to purchase the
right of applying the method on the new
canal. But the scheme failed for the reason
(as Mr. Cooper explained half a century
later) that the right of way for the Erie
Canal had been secured from the farmers of
the State by representing to them the profit
which they would realize from selling forage,
etc., for the use of canal boats, which were
to be drawn by horses or mules. The introduction
of mechanical power would destroy
these inducements, and the plan was
abandoned,&mdash;though Mr. Cooper had demonstrated
its feasibility by running his
endless chain on the East River for ten days
and carrying hundreds of passengers over
the trial route. It is not likely that such a
use of water power on the Erie Canal would
have proved practicable on a large scale;
but the endless chain, which Mr. Cooper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
apparently considered as a minor feature
only, has been adopted since, and lies at the
basis of the famous Belgian system of river
and canal transportation.</p>

<p>In 1824 the wave of enthusiastic sympathy
for the Greeks which swept over the
country upon receipt of the tidings of their
revolt against Turkish tyranny stimulated
Mr. Cooper to invent a torpedo boat, to be
steered from the shore by "two steel wires,
like the reins of a horse." But on the trial
trip of the boat a ship crossed and broke the
wires when about six of their total length of
ten miles had been let out. The delay made
the invention too late for use by the Greeks,
and it was not further pursued.</p>

<p>About 1835 the subject of aerial navigation
had in the United States one of its
periodical revivals. Mr. Cooper, believing
that a motive power developed from materials
of small weight was essential to the solution
of the problem, resolved to employ the explosive
force of chloride of nitrogen,&mdash;one
of the most dangerous compounds known to
chemists. The result of his experiments in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this direction was an explosion which blew
his apparatus to pieces, and nearly cost the
audacious inventor an eye. In fact, though
the organ was saved from total destruction,
it was permanently injured.</p>

<p>The conveyance of freight by aerial cables&mdash;a
method now widely used&mdash;was practiced
by Mr. Cooper at an early day. The
use of elevators in buildings was foreseen
and provided for by him in the erection of
the Cooper Union building, and in that
building also he introduced for the first time
iron beams as part of a fire-proof construction.
In these and other inventions his prophetic
intuitions were illustrated.</p>

<p>But such intuitions do not fully take the
place of scientific training; and one of the
inventions of Peter Cooper&mdash;which he considered
for many years, and possibly to the
very last, as his crowning achievement&mdash;was
a curious example of misdirected ingenuity.
It is worthy of notice here, however, for
another reason, namely, because of its accidental
association with one of its inventor's
most remarkable triumphs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>As a young apprentice he had studied the
steam engine, and had resolved that he would
improve it by doing away with the crank.
To his mind this was a source of great loss
of power, and he believed that, if he could
transform the rectilinear motion of the piston
rod directly into rotary motion without the
intervention of the crank, he would effect a
notable economy.</p>

<p>Now, there is no such loss of power through
the crank as he imagined, nor is it likely that
any other device for obtaining rotary from
rectilinear motion will be found superior to
that which Watt devised. But Peter Cooper
assailed this fancied evil with undoubting
confidence, both as to its existence and as to
his ability to do away with it. The result
was an invention for which he received,
April 28, 1828, letters patent of the United
States. At that early day patents were
comparatively few,&mdash;so few that this one
bears no number; and the duties of general
administration did not prevent the highest
officials from attending to details. This
patent, issued to Peter Cooper, of New York,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was personally signed by John Quincy Adams,
President; countersigned by Henry
Clay, Secretary of State; transmitted to
William Wirt, Attorney-General; examined,
approved, and signed by him, and returned
to the Department of State for final delivery
to the patentee. It grants for fourteen
years to the said Peter Cooper, his heirs, administrators,
and assignees the exclusive right
to make, use, or license others to use, the
described improvement in the method of effecting
rotary motion directly from the alternate
rectilinear motion of a steam piston.
Evidently these distinguished statesmen&mdash;Adams,
Clay, and Wirt&mdash;were not experts
in mechanics, or at least did not undertake
to hinder by technical criticism the experiments
of American ambition; and there was
no trained corps of patent-examiners to decide
upon the novelty, practicability, and
usefulness of any proposed improvement in
the arts. Probably the government shared
at that time the dominant American feeling
of unconquerable youth, ready to attack all
problems, especially those which previous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
experience had pronounced insoluble, and to
determine the impossible by attempting it.
This spirit has in fact more or less dominated
the United States Patent Office down to the
present time. With all its present equipment
of examiners, trained in theory and
versed in technical literature, it still concerns
itself chiefly in the consideration of a proposed
invention with the question of novelty,
rather than that of feasibility or value; and
the effect has been that, while thousands of
patents are granted for absurd, unnecessary,
or inoperative devices, the net result of the
encouragement thus given to individual ingenuity
and audacity is a catalogue of great
inventions unmatched in the history of any
other nation.</p>

<p>The patent of Peter Cooper, which now
lies before me,&mdash;a time-stained parchment
bearing the great seal of the United States
and the autographs of the famous men named
above,&mdash;is accompanied by no drawings;
but it contains a detailed specification which
shows that the invention consisted in an arrangement
by which, at each forward movement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a prolongation of the piston rod clawed
into an endless chain, which was pulled back
by the return stroke. This chain passed
around a wheel, to which it consequently
imparted a rotary motion.</p>

<p>Engineers do not need to be told that
this cumbrous arrangement could not successfully
replace the crank, even if such a
replacement were desirable. Yet the inventor
constructed a working-machine, and
satisfied himself, by a "duty trial" of some
sort, that it "saved two fifths of the steam."
His discovery, however, was not hailed with
immediate recognition by the mechanical
public; and its author, undisturbed in his
faith, bided his time.</p>

<p>This, by the way, points to a characteristic
of Peter Cooper, differentiating him
from the numerous enthusiasts whom prudent
men are accustomed to avoid. He
was not a man "of one idea." His fertile
and ingenious mind threw out its suggestions
in every direction, into fields untrodden
by experience; but when any such plan
failed of acceptance, he turned, with undiminished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
courage and hope, to something
else, remaining, nevertheless, still steadfast
in his former conception, and ready to seize
any opportunity for its realization.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Mr. Cooper's
abortive improvement upon the steam engine
was the source of his fame as the
builder of the first American locomotive, as
the following chapter will explain.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<h3>THE TOM THUMB</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the specification of the patent secured
in 1828 by Mr. Cooper for an improved
steam engine, he took pains to declare the
suitability of his invention as a motor for
"land carriages." No doubt he had heard
of Stephenson's "Rocket," if not of the
engine built by Blenkinsop in 1813, the
sight of which in operation caused Stephenson
to resolve that he would "make a better."
The famous competitive trial of the
Rocket, the Novelty, the Sanspareil, and
the Perseverance, on a two-mile section of
the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad, took
place in October, 1827, at which time Peter
Cooper must have been perfecting the application
for his patent.</p>

<p>But other circumstances played their part
in the result which we are about to consider.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Some time before 1830 Mr. Cooper had
been drawn into a land speculation at Canton,
in the suburbs of Baltimore. Failing
of support from his partners, he had been
obliged to buy them out, and to assume the
whole burden of the enterprise. Just at
that time there was great popular expectation
of the future importance of Baltimore.
A little earlier, there had been general despair
among the merchants of that city.
New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were
seeking the trade of the region beyond the
Alleghanies,&mdash;then "the West," but now
the centre of the population of the United
States. New York flanked the mountains
with her Erie Canal; Philadelphia got at
last a practicable, though less satisfactory,
water line; but Baltimore, though nearest
of all to the longed-for market, found,
through careful examination by eminent
engineers, that no canal was practicable for
her, at a cost within her means. In 1824
and 1825 the consequent general despondency
concerning the future of the city was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
so strong that Baltimore merchants began
to move to New York and Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>But at this period the world began to
hear of railways. A well-known merchant
of Baltimore, returning from England, described
with enthusiasm the coal trains,
drawn by the cumbrous ante-Stephenson
engines, which he had seen there. The
idea of a tramway (with or without steam
motors) found ready acceptance in a community
both enterprising and desperate. A
town meeting, held in 1826, to consider
Western communications, resulted in an application
to the Maryland legislature, and
the incorporation, in March, 1827, of the
Baltimore and Ohio,&mdash;the first railroad
company thus created in the United States
for purposes of general transportation,&mdash;the
leader of that vast multitude of similar enterprises,
the history of which is the history
of our nation's marvelous commercial progress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
By the legislative charter, the city
of Baltimore and the State of Maryland
were authorized to subscribe to the company's
stock.</p>

<p>In the address already cited, Mr. Latrobe,
an eye-witness, says of the scenes
which followed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then came a scene which almost beggars
description. By this time, public excitement
had gone beyond fever heat and
reached the boiling point. Everybody
wanted stock. The number of shares subscribed
were to be apportioned, if the limit
of the capital should be exceeded; and
every one set about obtaining proxies. Parents
subscribed in the names of their children,
and paid the dollar on each share that
the rules prescribed. Before even a survey
had been made, the possession of stock in
any quantity was regarded as a provision
for old age; and great was the scramble to
obtain it. The excitement in Baltimore
roused public attention elsewhere; and a
railroad mania began to pervade the land."</p>

<p>The proposed railroad was to pass through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Mr. Cooper's Canton property, which he
had already begun to develop, "so that it
should pay the taxes," by building upon it
charcoal kilns, after a design of his own,
with the purpose of turning the forest into
charcoal, and, by means of this fuel, smelting
the iron ore which the land contained.
What was the immediate commercial outcome
of this enterprise is not recorded.
Mr. Cooper's characteristic recollection, more
than sixty years later, was that, "with the
exception of a dangerous explosion," which
nearly cost him his life, the charcoal kilns
were "a great success!"</p>

<p>But the great value of the property was
expected to be realized through the new
railroad; and this expectation suffered a
serious blow when the horse cars failed to
pay expenses; the operation of the line was
suspended; the directors lost faith in the
enterprise; and many of the principal stockholders
declared that they would rather lose
the investment made so far than "throw
good money after bad." For the hope that
the new agency of steam might help them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
out was blighted by the news from England
that Stephenson had said that steam could
not be used as a motive power on a road
having curves of less than 900 feet radius;
and this road had, at Point of Rocks, a necessary
curve with a radius of only 150 feet!</p>

<p>The situation presented exactly the sort
of challenge calculated to arouse the courage
and ingenuity of Peter Cooper, besides
appealing to another of his personal characteristics,
namely, his undying and unalterable
faith in his own ideas and conclusions,
whether they had achieved recognition or
not. He could lay aside a scheme which
had not found immediate and successful application,
and turn his attention, with undiminished
vivacity, to something else; but
he never owned to a real defeat. And now
the problem presented at Baltimore seemed
to him a providential call for his intervention.
If the English engineers could not
run their locomotives around sharp curves,
it must be because they persisted in using
the vicious crank, which he had already superseded
by his (temporarily unappreciated)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
invention! And, with unshaken faith in
that device, he informed the Baltimore and
Ohio directors (to use the words in which,
long afterwards, he told the story) that he
thought he "could knock together a locomotive
which would get a train around the
Point of Rocks."</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance that, ever
since that day, the characteristic difference
between English and American locomotives
has been the ability of the latter to pass
curves of shorter radius than the former
can safely follow. The reason, as all railway
engineers know, is that the usual English
construction involves a rigid frame,
while the American has a movable truck or
"bogie" under the front part of the engine.
This solution of the problem was not
reached by Mr. Cooper. What he, in fact,
accomplished was simply a piece of audacity,
which encouraged the enterprise of his countrymen,
by proving that the dictum of limited
experience abroad was not conclusive.
Two features of his Baltimore experiment
were characteristic of him. The first was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that he undertook it, not merely in order to
vindicate his invention, but to effect a practical
result, namely, to make his land speculation
pay. And the second was that when
he found it difficult to operate his pet invention
in this experiment, he laid it aside
at once,&mdash;without losing an atom of faith
in it, but also without persisting (as a typical
enthusiast would have done) in risking
upon the vindication of his personal opinion
in one matter the success of another undertaking,
more immediately important.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper's own recollection of this
event deserves to be told in his own words.
He says:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I came back to New York for a little
bit of a brass engine of mine&mdash;about one
horse power (it had a 3&frac12; in. cylinder and
14 in. stroke)&mdash;and carried it back to Baltimore.
I got some boiler iron and made a
boiler about as high as an ordinary wash
boiler; and then how to connect the boiler
with the engine I didn't know. I couldn't
find any iron pipes. The fact was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
there were none for sale in this country.
So I took two muskets, broke off the wooden
parts, and used the barrels for tubing, one
on one side and the other on the other side
of the boiler. I went into a coach-maker's
shop and made this locomotive, which I
called the Tom Thumb, because it was so
insignificant. I didn't intend it for actual
service, but only to show the directors what
could be done. I meant to test two things:
first, I meant to show that short turns could
be made; and secondly, that I could get
rotary motion without the use of a crank.
I effected both of these things very nicely.
I changed the movement from a reciprocating
to a rotary motion.</p>

<p>"I got up steam one Saturday night.
The president of the road and two or three
other gentlemen were there. We got on
the truck and went out two or three miles.
All were delighted; for it opened new possibilities
for the railroad. I put up the locomotive
for the night in a shed, and invited
the company to ride to Ellicott's Mills
on Monday. Monday morning, what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
my chagrin to find that some scamp had
been there, and chopped off all the copper
from the engine,&mdash;doubtless in order to sell
it to some junk dealer!</p>

<p>"It took me a week or more to repair the
machine; then some one got in and broke a
piece out of the wheel, in experimenting
with it; and then two wheels, cast one after
the other, were damaged by the carelessness
of the turner. I was thoroughly disgusted
and discouraged; but, being determined
that I would not be balked entirely, I
changed the engine so that the power could
be applied through the ordinary connection
with a crank.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"At last all was ready; and, on a Monday,
we started,&mdash;six in the engine, and thirty-six
on the car which I took in tow. We
went up an average grade of eighteen feet
to the mile; made the thirteen miles to
Ellicott's Mills in one hour and twelve minutes;
and came back in fifty-seven minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The result of that experiment was that the
bonds of the railroad company were sold at
once, and there was no longer any doubt as
to the success of the road."</p>

<p>The Tom Thumb continued for several
weeks to make trips to Ellicott's Mills; and
on one occasion (September 18, 1830) ran a
race from Riley House into Baltimore (about
nine miles) with a light car, drawn on a
parallel track by a gray horse noted for speed
and endurance. The contest was planned
by the stagecoach proprietors of Baltimore,
with the view of demonstrating that nothing
could be gained by the substitution of steam
for horse power on the railroad. The gray
horse won the race, but not until after the
Tom Thumb had passed him, and only by
reason of a temporary breakdown of the
machine, which caused a delay too great to
be subsequently made up. Mr. Cooper's
characteristic recollection of the event, as
given fifty-five years later, was that "they
tried a little race one day, but it didn't
amount to anything. It was rather funny;
and the locomotive got out of gear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Latrobe says of the Tom Thumb:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The machine was not larger than the
hand cars used by workmen to transfer themselves
from place to place; and as the speaker
now recalls its appearance, the only wonder
is that so apparently insignificant a contrivance
should ever have been regarded as
competent to the smallest results. But Mr.
Cooper was wiser than many of the wisest
around him. His engine could not have
weighed a ton; but he saw in it a principle
which the forty-ton engines of to-day have
but served to develop and demonstrate.
The boiler of Mr. Cooper's engine was not
as large as the kitchen boiler attached to
many a range in modern mansions. It was
of about the same diameter, but not much
more than half as high. It stood upright
in the car, and was filled above the furnace,
which occupied the lower section, with vertical
tubes. The cylinder was but three
and one half inches in diameter; and speed
was got up by gearing. No natural draft
could have been sufficient to get up steam
in so small a boiler; and Mr. Cooper used,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
therefore, a blowing apparatus, driven by a
drum, attached to one of the car wheels, over
which passed a cord, that, in its turn, worked
a pulley on the shaft of the blower. The contrivance
for dispensing with a crank, though
its general appearance is recollected, the
speaker cannot describe with any accuracy;
nor is it important,&mdash;it came to nothing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"In a patent case, tried many years
afterwards, the boiler of Mr. Cooper's engine
became, in some connection which has been
forgotten, important as a piece of evidence.
It was hunted for, and found among some
old rubbish at Mount Clare. It was difficult
to imagine that it had even generated
steam enough to drive a coffee mill, much
less that it had performed the feats here
narrated."</p>

<p>After this experimental demonstration,
the Tom Thumb retired into honorable
but obscure repose in its maker's warehouse
at New York, from which it emerged, fifty
years later, to take part in the centennial
celebration of the beginning of the commercial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
history of Baltimore (that place having
been made a port of entry in 1780). According
to a contemporary report of the festival,
"in the vast procession, Mr. Cooper and his
little Tom Thumb locomotive were the two
most conspicuous objects, and received all
the honors which could be paid by a quarter
of a million of enthusiastic people."</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter Cooper's</span> acquaintance with the
affairs of New York city ranged from the
time when, as a child, he was taken by his
mother to see the last remaining fragments
of the stockade erected by the early inhabitants
for protection against the Indians, to
the full metropolitan glory of the decade of
his death. This wonderful municipal history
is too commonly regarded from a special
standpoint, as if it were but the record of a
continually renewed and often unsuccessful
struggle against corrupt and incompetent
city government. Contests of this kind,
under democratic institutions, always occupy
more space in the press, and make more
noise in public oratory, than the quiet but
steady progress of commercial undertakings,
and the labors of unselfish citizens for education,
art, and social improvement, which go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
on beneath the turbulent surface. Americans
have long suffered under the unjust imputation
of peculiar devotion to "the almighty
dollar." The fact is that in no other country
do individuals give so much or do so much
without pecuniary reward&mdash;whether for
personal friendship or for public spirit&mdash;as
in the United States. The munificence of
private benefactions and endowments, far
surpassing the government support given in
other nations to similar institutions, furnish
an abundant proof of the first half of this
proposition; while the other half is proved
by the innumerable boards, committees, and
other organized bodies, to which active business
men give time and thought without remuneration.</p>

<p>This spirit has never been wholly missed
in public affairs, even in the city of New
York, so often charged with the lack of it.
All the great features of its municipal progress,
even those which have been, at some
stage, tainted with lamentable corruption,
have been originated or supported by unselfish
public spirit. It might even be said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that without this support, innocently given
and deceitfully misused, the schemers for
private gain could not have achieved their
periodical and temporary successes.</p>

<p>Peter Cooper was an illustrious example
of good citizenship in this respect. First
elected to public office as "assistant alderman,"
in 1828, he turned his attention immediately
upon the subject most important
to the growth and welfare of a city, yet
most likely to be neglected until it is forced
upon the community as an unwelcome necessity,&mdash;namely,
the water supply. Up to
that time, New York had depended upon
the springs of Manhattan Island, some of
which supplied water, conveyed through the
streets by means of wooden pipes (bored
logs), while most of them were utilized by
means of pumps only, to which the inhabitants
sent for their supply.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Cooper induced the water committee,
of which he had been appointed a
member, to visit Philadelphia and inspect
the works by which the water of the Schuylkill
was raised to a high reservoir, and
thence distributed in iron pipes throughout
that city, and then to examine the Croton
and Bronx rivers, for the purpose of ascertaining
what these streams could supply.
The season being dry, the rivers were so low
that Mr. Cooper was not satisfied of their
capacity to furnish the needed quantity; so
he investigated further, on his own account,
the watershed (then a wilderness) of the
Hackensack River in New Jersey, and subsequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
submitted to the board of aldermen
plans and models, illustrating a scheme
for the supply of water to New York from
that region, by means of pipes laid under
the North River.</p>

<p>To the end of his life, Mr. Cooper adhered
to his preference for this method of
conveying water across river channels, as
compared with elevated aqueducts, like the
"high bridge" subsequently constructed
across the Harlem River. And in this particular,
his intuitive engineer's judgment was
not at fault, although the classic example
of the Romans, who spent untold labor
and time in building aqueducts, where buried
conduits would have been both cheaper
and better, still dominated the professional
world. But Peter Cooper furnished another
example of his practical wisdom, by sacrificing
his superior theory for the sake of the
useful result contemplated. Thorough study
showed that, although the Croton region
could not be relied upon at all times for an
immediately adequate water supply, yet its
average through the year was sufficient for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the purpose, so that the creation, by means
of higher dams, of large storage reservoirs,
would solve the pressing problem. This plan
was ultimately adopted, and has been pursued
with suitable enlargements, ever since.
Peter Cooper was made chairman of the
water committee,&mdash;a position which he
retained until some years after the Croton
system was completed.</p>

<p>In the procurement of iron pipes for the
system of distribution, and their proper testing
before acceptance, his integrity and intelligence
were specially effective in protecting
the interests of the city, by securing the
best material at the lowest cost. While Mr.
Cooper was a strong "protectionist," favoring
the encouragement of American industries,
he never recognized any distinctions
among Americans. In his patriotic thought,
the unit to be regarded was not the city or
the State of New York, but the United
States of America; and he earnestly opposed
the contention of the New York iron founders,
that contracts for the pipe of the Croton
system ought not to be made with inhabitants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of another State. His arguments prevailed;
and the pipe was ordered from a
Philadelphia manufacturer, who offered a
better article at a lower price.</p>

<p>During Mr. Cooper's official service, and
not without his active aid and advice (though
his personal attention was mainly given to
the water department), the beginnings of an
organized police and fire service were established.
When he was first elected to office
the city was guarded by watchmen, who
served four hours every night for seventy-five
cents. Every householder was expected
to have leathern buckets in his hall, and in
case of an alarm of fire to throw them into
the street, so that the citizens voluntarily
running to the rescue could form a line to
the nearest pump, and, passing the water by
means of the buckets, supply the tank of the
small hand-engine, which then squirted it
upon the burning building. It is needless to
detail here the steps by which out of this
crude beginning the present effective New
York Fire Department has been perfected.
Suffice it to say that the beginning itself was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
promoted, and its future importance was
foreseen, by Peter Cooper and his public-spirited
colleagues.</p>

<p>But a still more profoundly important
element of municipal and national progress,
in which the participation of Peter Cooper
was active and influential, was the free
public school system in New York. This
system was originally planted by the great
mayor and governor, De Witt Clinton, to
whom the State is indebted for the Erie
Canal, and for many other plans and impulses
scarcely less significant. While Clinton
was an advocate of universal suffrage,
he perceived the danger of granting this
power to an ignorant and largely foreign
population; and in 1805 he secured a charter
for "The Society for Establishing a
Free School in the City of New York for
the Education of Such Poor Children as do
not Belong to, or are not Provided for by,
Any Religious Society."</p>

<p>The appeal of this society to "the affluent
and charitable of every denomination of
Christians" was liberally answered, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
December, 1809, a school capable of accommodating
five hundred children had been
erected upon a purchased site. This was
the beginning in New York city of the free
school system, over which for twenty-five
years De Witt Clinton presided. During that
period the schools, supported by generous
private contributions, and also after a while
by a state tax, steadily increased in number,
efficiency, and public favor. Peter Cooper
had been always a zealous supporter of these
schools, but not until 1838 did he become&mdash;by
election as a trustee of the Free
School Society&mdash;officially connected with
them. It was a critical period in their history.
The original national debt of the
Union had been recently extinguished, and
a considerable surplus had been returned to
the contributing States, of which New York
devoted its share to educational purposes,
thus largely increasing the fund for the city.
In 1822, sixteen years before, the common
council had made the free schools "unsectarian,"
excluding from the benefits of the
fund all institutions of denominational character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The various sects had submitted reluctantly
to this decision so long as the fund
was too small to be divided among them;
but its sudden enlargement encouraged an
attempt to secure appropriations for parochial
schools.</p>

<p>In his first annual message Governor
Seward recommended to the legislature the
establishment of schools in which the children
of foreigners might be "instructed by
teachers speaking the same language with
themselves and professing the same faith."
The Roman Catholic community, acting at
once upon this suggestion, sent a deputation
to the New York common council demanding
for their schools "a pro rata share" of
the educational fund, to which as taxpayers
they contributed.</p>

<p>In the resistance made to this claim by
the Free School Society Mr. Cooper took a
prominent and ardent part. The advocates
of unsectarian public schools were victorious;
but the controversy continued to agitate the
State until the passage by the legislature in
1842 of an act establishing in New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
city a new board of education to control
the schools supported from the funds of the
State, and at the same time forbidding the
support from this fund of schools in which
"any religious sectarian doctrine or tenet
shall be taught, inculcated, or practiced."
The Free School Society, resenting and distrusting
this new (and in some respects
complicated) arrangement, continued its
separate activity for eleven years; but in
1853, the unsectarian character of the public
schools of New York having been established
beyond question, the society and
the board of education were by common
consent amalgamated by statute. At the
final meeting of the society Peter Cooper
delivered the valedictory address, the language
of which indicates that not without
apprehension did he contemplate the surrender
of the public schools to the exclusive
control of a body of officials likely to be
more or less influenced by partisan or political
considerations.</p>

<p>Yet his characteristic common sense came
again in this instance to the front. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
moral which he drew from his doubts and
fears was that "the stewardship we are about
to resign is not a reprieve from the responsibilities
of the future." And in obedience to
this conviction he accepted, with fourteen of
his old colleagues, membership in the board
of education, of which he served for two years
as vice-president, resigning in January, 1855,
at which time he had formed and begun to
carry out the great plan of an institution for
free popular education with which his name
is now forever associated.</p>

<p>Many years later Mr. Cooper became the
president of the Citizens' Association of
New York, which he supported with untiring
enthusiasm and lavish expenditure, and which
in its day did good work in securing for the
city an efficient fire department, boards of
health, docks, and education, and an improved
charter. Mr. Cooper retired in 1873,
and the association died soon after, to be
revived in other organizations, which have
from time to time continued the perennial
battle for good government in New York
begun by him.</p>

<h3>THE COOPER UNION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AND ART</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> many respects the industrial conditions
under which Peter Cooper began his career
had been revolutionized before he finished
it. The apprentice system has well-nigh
passed away; and the old freedom with
which an intelligent, industrious, and ambitious
young man could turn from one occupation
to another, seeking that road which
offered greatest promise of preferment, is
greatly hampered by the modern regime of
"organized labor," which, whatever its advantages,
presents its own peculiar perils
for the workingman. But it remains forever
true that under either of these systems,
or any others that can be evolved or invented,
knowledge is power, and the bestowal of it
is the one gift which neither pauperizes the
recipient nor injures the community.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>As a struggling young apprentice, Peter
Cooper regarded with intense sympathy the
needs and limitations of the class to which
he belonged. But his notion of a remedy
was not that of paternal legislation, or belligerent
organization, or social reconstruction.
To his conception the atmosphere of
personal liberty and responsibility furnished
by the new democratic republic, offering free
scope to individual endeavor and rewarding
individual merit, was the best that could be
asked.</p>

<p>What he dreamed of doing was simply to
assist these social conditions by providing
for those who were handicapped by circumstances
the means of power and opportunity,
to be utilized by their own assiduity.
This plan included not only what he then
thought to be the most effective system
for intellectual improvement, but also provision
for such innocent entertainment as
would supersede the grosser forms of recreation,
which involved the waste of money and
health.</p>

<p>Walking up the Bowery Road&mdash;then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
stage route to Boston, but now a crowded
down-town street&mdash;he selected in the suburbs
of the city the site for his great institution;
and, as he accumulated the necessary
funds, he bought at intervals lot after lot at
the intersection of Third and Fourth Avenues,
until he had acquired the entire block,
paying for his latest purchases (made after
the neighborhood had been solidly built up
and had become a centre of business) very
high prices compared with those he had paid
at the beginning. At last (in 1854) he
commenced the erection of a six-story fire-proof
building of stone, brick, and iron. This
work occupied several years, and during its
progress a period of great financial distress
threatened to interrupt it. But he persisted
in the undertaking, at great risk to his private
business; and the building was finished at a
cost (including that of the land) of more
than six hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
Subsequent gifts from Mr. Cooper,
together with the legacy provided by his
will, and doubled by his heirs, and still later
donations from his family and immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
relatives, make up a total of more than
double that amount.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>Up to the time when the building was
completed Mr. Cooper had taken little advice
as to the details of his project. Its outlines
in his mind were those which he had conceived
a quarter-century before, and though
he was doubtless conscious that new social
and industrial conditions had intervened
which would require some modifications of
his plan, he had not formulated such changes.</p>

<p>The classes which he wished especially
to reach were those who, being already engaged
in earning a living by labor, could
scarcely be expected to take regular courses
in instruction; and the idea of such instruction
appears to have been at the beginning
subordinate in his mind. He had a strong
impression that young mechanics and apprentices,
instead of wasting their time in
dissipation, should improve their minds during
the intervals of labor; and not unnaturally
his first thought as to the means of
such improvement turned to those things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which had aroused and stimulated his own
mind. Probably he did not realize that the
mass of men were not like himself, and that
something more than mere suggestion or opportunity
would be required to develop the
mental powers and enlarge the knowledge of
the average workingman. However that
may be, the original vague design of Mr.
Cooper was something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was in the city of New York a
famous collection of curiosities known as
Scudder's Museum. Barnum's Museum
afterwards took its place; but that, too, has
long since disappeared; and the small so-called
museums now scattered through the
city but faintly remind old inhabitants of
the glories of Scudder's or Barnum's in their
prime. These establishments contained all
sorts of curiosities, arranged without much
reference to scientific use,&mdash;wax-works, historical
relics, dwarfs, giants, living and
stuffed animals, etc. There was also a
lecture-room, devoted principally to moral
melodrama; and on an upper floor a large
room was occupied by the cosmorama,&mdash;an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
exhibition of pictures, usually of noteworthy
scenery, foreign cities, etc., which
were looked at through round holes, enhancing
the effect of their illumination.</p>

<p>Peter Cooper doubtless often lingered in
these museums, receiving the inspiration
which came from visions of a world much
wider than his individual horizon, from the
curious and wonderful works of nature, and
from the works of man in former times and
in foreign lands. From the queer mechanical
devices exhibited by inventors to the
"Happy Family" and the cosmorama, everything
was full to his quick sympathy of intellectual,
moral, or sentimental suggestion;
and no doubt he felt, after an hour of such
combined wonder and reflection, a satisfying
sense of time well spent.</p>

<p>He wished that this means of mental improvement
and recreation combined might
be freely afforded to those whose scanty
earnings would not permit them otherwise to
make frequent use of it, and he resolved
that the museum and the cosmorama should
be included in his institution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Another agency of which Mr. Cooper had
made fruitful use, and the efficacy of which
he highly appreciated, was conversation and
debate. If people could be brought together
and made to talk he thought they would
learn a great deal from each other. In this
he had undoubtedly grasped one of the great
principles of progress. To meet and interchange
our ideas of books and by personal
discussions is indeed the mightiest factor of
modern improvement. But the mere meeting
to talk <i>about</i> things unless it is combined
with the disposition and the apparatus
for <i>studying</i> things is but barter without
production, and may degenerate to a barren
exchange of words, as unprofitable as that
described in the Yankee proverb, "swapping
jackknives in a garret." This aspect of the
truth Mr. Cooper doubtless came to appreciate;
but at the outset, habituated as he
was to get ideas from everybody he met and
everything he saw, it seemed to him that
free discussions would be an unmixed benefit
to all, and he resolved that his institution
should contain rooms, devoted to the several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
handicrafts, where the practitioners of each
could meet and "exchange views."</p>

<p>It was also his intention that the lower
part of the building he erected should be occupied
by stores and offices, the annual rent of
which should pay the running expenses of the
institution. In the course of time the Cooper
Union came to need for full efficiency both
more money than this source would supply
and more room than was left to it after subtracting
the rooms thus rented. These needs
have now been met in some measure by further
endowments, so that before long the
whole building will be devoted to educational
uses. But the wisdom, at that time, of Mr.
Cooper's plan has been vindicated by the
great work done with the modest means
thus provided.</p>

<p>The building of the Cooper Union represented
his original ideas. Above the shops
and offices to be rented was an immense
room intended for the museum. A large
part of the building was cut up into small
meeting-rooms for the conferences of the
trades; in an upper story another great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
room was provided for the cosmorama; and
the flat roof was to be safely inclosed with a
balustrade, so that on pleasant days or evenings
the frequenters of the institution might
sit or promenade there, partake of harmless
refreshments, listen to agreeable music,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
enjoy the magnificent prospect of the city
below,&mdash;the heights beyond the East River
on one side, the Hudson on the other, and
the magnificent island-studded harbor.</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of this scheme was
the complete obliteration of all distinctions
of class, creed, race, or sex among its beneficiaries.
It is a significant fact that through
nearly half a century, while these distinctions
have been the subjects of vehement and sometimes
bitter social and political discussion, the
Cooper Union has gone quietly on educating
its thousands of pupils without the least embarrassment
in its discipline, and apparently
without even the consciousness on the part
of its founder or its trustees that in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
perfect solution of what was supposed to be
a difficult problem they had accomplished
anything extraordinary.</p>

<p>When Mr. Cooper, consulting with wise
and practical advisers, addressed himself at
last to the final arrangement of details, he
surrendered one after another many parts of
his youthful design. The name, "The Cooper
Union for the Advancement of Science and
Art," epitomized this change. His primary
purpose was unchanged; but he perceived
that systematic education would be of more
value to the class he sought to aid than mere
amusement or miscellaneous talk. The great
free reading-room of the Cooper Union was
substituted for the museum; the conversation
parlors for the various trades became
class-rooms for instruction; the cosmorama
yielded to lecture-halls and laboratories; and
the roof was abandoned to the weather. To
all these changes, and to many other novelties
adopted afterwards, Mr. Cooper was
reconciled by one conclusive argument;
namely, the proof afforded by their results
that the Cooper Union was giving to the working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
classes that which they needed most and
most desired. Now and then perhaps a sigh
might escape him for the dream of his youth.
I remember one occasion when I accompanied
him to the roof of the building, where
some new construction was going on which
he wished to inspect. The old man stood
for some time admiring the view in all directions,
and at last, recalling how he had once
imagined happy crowds enjoying the delights
of that "roof-garden," and casting a mournful
glance at the central spot where the band
was to have been, he said, "Sometimes I
think my first plan was the best!"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But
such regrets did not occupy his mind. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was satisfied to know that the institution he
had founded, building better than he knew,
had proved its fitness by its success in the
eager and grateful use made of it by those
for whose benefit it was intended and in the
actual evidences of such benefit. Every year
managers of the different departments took
pains to report to him instances in which
students already earning wages had increased
their earnings through the added knowledge
or skill acquired in the evening classes; and
this was the feature of the annual statements
upon which he dwelt with the greatest satisfaction.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>The charter of the Cooper Union was
finally adopted in its present form by the
legislature of the State of New York,
April 13, 1859; and the deed of trust, executed
in compliance therewith, on the 29th
day of the same month, by Peter Cooper
and his wife, Sarah, conveyed to the board
of trustees the title to "all that piece and
parcel of land bounded on the west by
Fourth Avenue, on the north by Astor
Place, on the east by Third Avenue, and on
the south by Seventh Street, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be forever
devoted to the advancement of science
and art, in their application to the varied and
useful purposes of life."</p>

<p>Even through this dry legal phraseology,
it is not difficult to discern the frank and
simple joy of the patient enthusiast, who
was at last able to speak of the land which
he had laboriously acquired, lot by lot,
through many years, and the building which
he had raised, stone by stone, through many
more, as <i>one</i> "piece or parcel," his to dedicate
forever.</p>

<p>The delivery of this deed to the board of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
trustees was accompanied with a long letter,
setting forth the wishes, hopes, and plans
of the grantor, in the formal and diffuse
rhetoric peculiar to his generation, and, perhaps,
too much contemned by ours. To say
the least, we are no more warranted in despising
the utterances of noble, self-sacrificing
philanthropists, because they are clothed in
phrases now deemed verbose and stilted,
than we would be in disparaging the deeds
of historic heroes, because they wore armor
now antiquated and struck their doughty
blows with weapons obsolete. When Peter
Cooper wrote, in the letter now before me,
"The great object I desire to accomplish by
the establishment of an institution devoted
to the advancement of science and art is to
open the volume of nature by the light of
truth&mdash;so unveiling the laws and methods
of Deity that the young may see the beauties
of creation, enjoy its blessings, and learn to
love the Being 'from whom cometh every
good and perfect gift,'"&mdash;he was not guilty
of cant, because cant is the use of language
expressing an emotion which the user does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
not really feel. And the same may be said of
the elaborate additional exposition, contained
in this letter, of the writer's faith in God and
man, and of his confident hope in the future
of his race, and particularly of his country.</p>

<p>The letter shows some traces still of his
original plan. Thus, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In order most effectually to aid and
encourage the efforts of youth to obtain useful
knowledge, I have provided the main
floor of the large hall on the third story for
a reading-room, literary exchange, and scientific
collections&mdash;the walls around that floor
to be arranged for the reception of books,
maps, paintings, and other objects of interest.
And when a sufficient collection of the works
of art, science, and nature can be obtained,
I propose that glass cases shall be arranged
around the walls of the gallery of the said
room, forming alcoves around the entire
floor for the preservation of the same. In
the window spaces I propose to arrange such
cosmoramic and other views as will exhibit
in the clearest and most forcible light the
true philosophy of life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Other characteristic paragraphs are here
quoted,&mdash;the whole letter being too long
for full republication.</p>

<p>"To manifest the deep interest and sympathy
I feel in all that can advance the happiness
and better the condition of the female
portion of the community, and especially of
those who are dependent on honest labor for
support, I desire the trustees to appropriate
two hundred and fifty dollars yearly to assist
such pupils of the female school of design
as shall, in their careful judgment, by their
efforts and sacrifices in the performance of
duty to parents or to those that Providence
has made dependent on them for support,
merit and require such aid. My reason for
this requirement is not so much to reward
as to encourage the exercise of heroic virtues
that often shine in the midst of the
greatest suffering and obscurity without so
much as being noticed by the passing
throng.</p>

<p>"In order to better the condition of women
and to widen the sphere of female employment,
I have provided seven rooms to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be forever devoted to a female school of
design, and I desire the trustees to appropriate
out of the rents of the building fifteen
hundred dollars annually towards meeting
the expenses of said school.</p>

<p>"It is the ardent wish of my heart that
this school of design may be the means of
raising to competence and comfort thousands
of those that might otherwise struggle
through a life of poverty and suffering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Desiring, as I do, to use every means to
render this institution useful through all
coming time, and believing that editors of
the public press have it in their power to
exert a greater influence on the community
for good than any other class of men of
equal number, it is therefore my sincere
desire that editors be earnestly invited to
become members of the society of arts to
be connected with this institution.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"It is my desire, also, that the students
shall have the use of one of the large rooms
(to be assigned by the trustees) for the purpose
of useful debates. I desire and deem
it best to direct that all these lectures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
debates shall be exclusive of theological and
party questions, and shall have for their
constant object the causes that operate
around and within us, and the means necessary
and most appropriate to remove the
physical and moral evils that afflict our city,
our country, and humanity." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Other paragraphs indicate his plan that
the students shall, in the first instance, frame
the rules which shall control the discipline
of the institution. Thus he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is my desire, and I hereby ordain,
that a strict conformity to rules deliberately
formed by a vote of the majority of the
students, and approved by the trustees, shall
forever be an indispensable requisite for
continuing to enjoy the benefits of this institution.
I now most earnestly entreat each
and every one of the students of this institution,
through all coming time, to whom I
have intrusted this great responsibility of
framing laws for the regulation of their conduct
in their connection with the institution,
and by which any of the members may lose
its privileges, to remember how frail we are,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and how liable to err when we come to sit
in judgment on the faults of others, and
how much the circumstances of our birth,
our education, and the society and country
where we have been born and brought up,
have had to do in forming us and making us
what we are."</p>

<p>In this scheme Mr. Cooper anticipated
the plan of self-government now followed in
some of our colleges; and while he expected
too much of the students of the
Cooper Union, and was himself afterwards
obliged to consent to the restriction of their
autonomy, it may be fairly said that the
spirit of his hope and exhortation has never
ceased to be felt; and, to the great honor
of the Cooper Union, it may be recorded
that questions of discipline have been well-nigh
unknown within its walls.</p>

<p>This noble trust was accepted by a body
of men who have discharged it with unwearied
fidelity, zeal and wisdom. The
original board consisted of Mr. Cooper, his
son Edward Cooper, his son-in-law Abram
S. Hewitt, and John E. Parsons, Wilson G.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Hunt, and Daniel F. Tiemann. Three of
these, Messrs. Cooper, Hewitt, and Tiemann,
have been mayors of the city of New York.
All of them were well-known and eminent
citizens, burdened with the duties of active
business; and the time they gave so freely
to the management of the Cooper Union was
not the superfluity of leisure. The difficulty
with "business men" too often is, that,
when nominally charged with the administration
of organized charities, they slight
the work because they have not time to attend
to it. But the United States can show
not a few instances in which the affairs of
religious, educational, or benevolent institutions
are carefully managed by the active
directors of great private enterprises; and
their management, when it is thus thorough,
is generally much better than that of literary
or philanthropic amateurs. This is conspicuously
shown in the history of the Cooper
Union.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>This is not the place for a detailed account
of the development of the Cooper
Union, or even of its present scope and prospective
operations. Such an account would
worthily occupy a separate volume; for the
institution, in the hands of its wise directors,
was a pioneer and model in many respects
in which later enterprises, with larger
means, have, perhaps, surpassed it. I must
content myself here with brief mention of a
few particulars.</p>

<p>The immense free reading-room, with its
average daily attendance of nearly 1500 to
2000 persons, was Mr. Cooper's special
delight; and well it might be so; for the
sight is one almost without a parallel&mdash;not
in the architecture, size, or furnishing of the
place, but in the extent and constancy of its
use by the public. Entrance is free to all
who are not unclean, intoxicated, or disorderly.
In the main, the privileges thus given
are not abused, but occasionally the evils almost
inseparable from so large an attendance
have been felt. At one time, the curator
earnestly represented to the trustees the necessity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of doing something to check the mutilation
of books&mdash;a practice which public
librarians know well as one of their most
troublesome foes. It appeared that some
unknown persons, who combined a love of
the beautiful in language with a barbaric
ignorance of it in conduct, were accustomed
to slash out with their penknives favorite
passages of poetry for preservation, treating
in this matter newspapers and books alike.
It was found difficult to keep whole the volumes
of Tennyson and Longfellow. But a
more frequent and injurious practice was
the cutting out of plates from illustrated
books. This was not for love of art, as the
other for love of poetry. The object was to
sell such engravings for two or three cents
each to the print-shops in the city, where
they were bought by refined amateurs, for
the purpose of "illustrating" special volumes.
This fashionable hobby has been the
indirect cause of the ruin of many a choice
book; and buyers of fine old editions are well
aware that they must look well to their bargains,
lest they find that the thief, at the bidding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the "collector," has plundered the volumes
of the plates which once adorned them.</p>

<p>When this subject came up for discussion
in the board of trustees, Mr. Cooper was
so full of pity for the poor fellows, who
were obliged to sell stolen engravings at
two cents a piece to keep body and soul
together, that he could scarcely be brought
to take a severe view of the offense. Nor
was he willing (and in this his fellow-trustees
agreed with him) to impose any restriction
or censorship upon admittance to the
reading-room. Even if the books suffered,
the room must continue to be free. The
great mass of well-behaved people must not
be annoyed by measures intended to exclude
a few rogues. The result vindicated the
sagacity, as well as the charity, of this view.
The officers in charge, not being permitted
to adopt any sweeping measures of prevention,
simply redoubled their vigilance, and
finally caught one or two offenders and
"made examples of them;" and the nuisance
was immediately abated, though perhaps not
entirely and permanently abolished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The report of 1900, after mentioning the
great (legitimate) wear and tear of the
books, of which 12,000 had to be re-bound,
adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The decorum of the visitors has been
excellent, and it is remarkable, in view of
such a very large number of persons visiting
the room, that so few mutilations and
injuries occur to the periodicals and books,
and that so few books, probably not more
than half a dozen in the course of a year,
and those of small consequence, are stolen."</p>

<p>It seems then, after all, that Peter Cooper's
faith in the people was justified.</p>

<p>The great hall in the basement is another
noteworthy feature, and worthy of
wider imitation than it has yet received.
Such a hall, if located upstairs in such a
building, would have been open to three objections:
it would have monopolized, for occasional
use only, space which was required
for constant use; it would have been intolerably
noisy, by reason of the roar and rattle
in the streets which surround the building
on all sides; and it would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dangerous, as all such places are, when great
audiences must make their exit by going
down stairs. Nothing has ever been invented
that will prevent people from being
crushed and trampled when they are crowding
down a stairway. In all these respects,
the great hall of the Cooper Union is admirable.
It occupies space not otherwise valuable.
It is quiet, and acoustically perfect.
The means of exit and entrance are ample
and safe. Even in case of an unreasoning
panic, there is little danger that a crowd,
tumbling up the stone stairways to the
street, would cause the horrible maiming
and killing which so often attend the efforts
of a frightened multitude to get down. Finally,
the ventilation is excellent, for the
simple reason that natural or automatic ventilation
of such a large, low basement room
could not be expected, and consequently
mechanical ventilation by means of a large
fan, run by steam power, was provided. The
efficiency of this system has sometimes been
severely tested. On one occasion, during
a scientific lecture, the experimental illustrations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of which were on a large and imposing
scale, the learned professor on the platform
had the misfortune to crack an immense
glass jar, in which he was exhibiting the
brilliant combustion of phosphorus in oxygen
gas. The white fumes of phosphorous
acid floated out into the air, and began to
diffuse themselves through the hall towards
the ventilation outlets at the sides and rear.
To one who knew the irritating nature of
these fumes it seemed inevitable that the
hall must be emptied of its crowded audience
in a few minutes. Already coughing
had begun on the front seats, when Mr.
Hewitt, who was seated on the platform,
quickly rose, and pulling a cord, reversed
the currents of ventilation and opened a
new outlet into the street, behind and above
the platform. The curling clouds of vapor
paused, wheeled, and retreated, and in another
minute the air was perfectly pure.
The lecturer had not even been interrupted.
It was a beautiful and timely "experiment"
not on the programme, and, to use the words
of one who was present, "It was just the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sort of thing to please Peter Cooper to the
bottom of his soul."</p>

<p>The great hall was dedicated from the
beginning to free speech. Peter Cooper
may have overestimated the value of mere
talk. As I have already told, it was his
first notion that conversation and discussion
were the chief things required in education.
He came to see that study, instruction, and
training were equally essential, but he never
surrendered his faith in free speech; and
the great hall was at the service of all sects,
parties, and classes, religious, philosophical,
political, scientific, literary, or philanthropic.
It has been the scene of many memorable
meetings and addresses. But nothing in its
history has been more useful and noteworthy
than the series of free popular lectures which
were given, as part of the operations of the
Cooper Union, within its walls. These lectures
began in 1868, and continued until
they were adopted by the city as part of the
general scheme of free lectures which has
been so successful during the last few years.
In awarding due praise to the promoters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and managers of this plan, it should not be
forgotten that the Cooper Union inaugurated
it, and maintained it for many years, during
which the free Saturday night popular
lectures in its great hall were the only ones
of their kind. They covered many sciences
and arts, chronicles of travel and themes of
history and literature. The most eminent
authors, teachers, investigators, travelers,
and orators of the generation were comprised
in the list of lecturers; and many of them
performed this service without other reward
than the consciousness of contributing to a
noble charity, and the evident gratitude of
the vast and eagerly attentive audience.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper loved to attend these Saturday
evening lectures, and an arm-chair was
always ready for him on the platform.
Many a speaker on that platform has been
surprised by an untimely outburst of applause
and has turned to discover the cause in the
entrance of the beloved founder. Often
the subject of the evening was beyond his
experience or knowledge, but that made no
difference in his respectful attention, or in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the benign satisfaction with which he contemplated
the attentive audience, and realized
that they were receiving benefit. I have
often felt that the scene exhibited almost
every Saturday night for many years during
the latest period of his life could be equaled
only by the spectacle presented at Ephesus,
where the aged St. John the Divine fronted
the congregation of loving believers, always
with his one last message, "Little children,
love one another."</p>

<p>But sometimes the old man would be intensely
interested and aroused by the lecture.
I remember such an occasion, when I was myself
the lecturer, and had been laying down,
with due scientific decorum and diagrams, the
"law of storms." At the close of the lecture,
Mr. Cooper arose, advanced to the
front, and gave a vivid and animated description
of a whirlwind which he had witnessed
some seventy years before, which was
received with rapt attention and tremendous
applause. The lecture was undoubtedly
eclipsed in interest by this unexpected
after-piece; but the lecturer was amply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
compensated by his triumph in having thus
stirred the spirit and aroused the recollections
of the dear old founder.</p>

<p>With regard to the various schools and
classes of the Cooper Union, it must suffice
to say briefly that under the elastic and
comprehensive plan of the deed of trust,
two objects were constantly kept in view by
the trustees. In the first place, a complete
four years' course was always maintained,
for the benefit of those who could afford the
time and who felt the need of such training.
In the second place, classes were instituted
in such special departments as were most
likely to be useful and most evidently in demand;
and with regard to these the demand
and the evidence of usefulness were followed
as guides in determining the extent of the
facilities offered, up to the capacity and
means of the institution.</p>

<p>De Morgan, in his "Budget of Paradoxes,"
tells of an old fellow who, wishing
to have a chair that would fit him perfectly,
sat for a while on a mass of shoemaker's
wax, which he then carried to a worker in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wood, and instructed him to "make a seat
like that!" This homely illustration indicates
the manner in which the special classes
of the Cooper Union have been established,
enlarged, and regulated, to meet the evident
demands of its constituency. It is
pleasant to know that the future means and
sphere of the institution will be enlarged
under the same wise management.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>NATIONAL POLITICS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter Cooper's</span> prominent activity in
national politics belongs to two periods,&mdash;that
of the war for the Union, and that of
the subsequent controversies over questions
of financial policy.</p>

<p>As has been explained, he felt his life to be
peculiarly identified with that of the nation
born with him; and the idea that this nation
should be destroyed in the midst of its triumphant
progress was profoundly abhorrent
to him. Like many other patriots, he was
ready to save the Union by a compromise, if
that were practicable. He advocated the
purchase and liberation by the government
of all the slaves in the United States; he
promoted a "peace conference" on the very
eve of the war. But when South Carolina
had formally seceded and the gauntlet had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
been cast at the feet of national authority, his
course was not uncertain. He was a representative
of the New York Chamber of Commerce
in the deputation of thirty leading
citizens of New York which visited Washington
in order to discover what plan Mr.
Buchanan (then still President) had in
view. They got no satisfaction from the
President, but assured themselves of the
firm loyalty of Mr. Seward, then Senator
from New York.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the bombardment of
Fort Sumter put an end to all projects of
compromise. At the memorable mass meeting
held in Union Square, New York, shortly
after the receipt of this news, Peter Cooper,
then seventy years old, was among the first
to mount the platform. His familiar white
hairs and kindly face were recognized by the
crowd, which vociferously called for a speech
from him. Stepping to the front, he uttered
a few ringing sentences which sounded the
keynote of the meeting. I quote but one or
two:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are contending with an enemy not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
only determined on our destruction as a nation,
but to build on our ruins a government
devoted with all its power to maintain, extend,
and perpetuate a system in itself revolting
to all the best feelings of humanity,&mdash;an
institution that enables thousands to
sell their own children into hopeless bondage.</p>

<p>"Shall it succeed? You say 'No!' and
I unite with you in your decision. We cannot
allow it to succeed. We should spend
our lives, our property, and leave the land
itself a desolation before such an institution
should triumph over the free people of this
country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Let us, therefore, unite to sustain the
government by every means in our power, to
arm and equip in the shortest possible time
an army of the best men that can be found
in the country."</p>

<p>From that day on his patriotism never
doubted or faltered. When the war loan
was announced he was the first man at the
door of the subtreasury in New York waiting
to make payment over the counter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
all the money he had been able to collect
without business disaster. "In those days,"
says a friend, "whenever he had nothing
else to do, he would go down to the recruiting
office and put in a substitute." It is
estimated that he must have sent, first and
last, about a score of soldiers to serve for him
under the flag.</p>

<p>From the first he urged the emancipation
and enlistment of the Southern negroes,&mdash;a
policy which was ultimately adopted with
successful results; and when in 1864, at the
darkest hour of the struggle, there was danger
of a fatal compromise, he actively promoted
that great mass meeting in the hall of
the Cooper Union which marked the turning-point
of the struggle, carried the State of
New York for Lincoln, and secured the triumph
of the Union.</p>

<p>After the war was over he presided at another
meeting, called to favor aid to the disabled
soldiers of the nation; and the following
paragraph quoted from his remarks on that
occasion forms a fitting close to this brief
notice of his patriotic activity:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we required a stronger stimulus to
urge us to perform our duty, we have only
to turn our thoughts back to that fearful
day when the armies of rebellion had entered
Pennsylvania with the intent to subjugate
the North to their domination. Had they
been successful, they would have gloried in
making us pay for the loss of their slaves
and the expenses of their war. I trust that
the government will not hesitate to tax my
property and the property of every other
man enough to provide for the comfort of
our disabled soldiers and the families dependent
on them for support."</p>

<p>In the financial controversies which accompanied
and followed the period of "reconstruction"
after the war, and were involved
in the payment and adjustment of the national
debt, Mr. Cooper appeared as an advocate
of the "Greenback" party, and did
not seem to realize that this was a complete
reversal of his earlier position as a "hard-money"
Democrat. I think the clue to this
change may be found in his recollection of
the war waged by Andrew Jackson on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
United States Bank, and a vague feeling
that the national banking system instituted
by Secretary Chase was open to similar objections.
To this may be added his growing
inclination in favor of "paternal government,"&mdash;which
in a man so thoroughly
self-supporting and self-reliant can be explained
only by the fact that his personal
philanthropy overbalanced his political philosophy;
that he became more anxious to
relieve the distress he saw than to question
the wisdom of measures taken for that purpose.
Two things are certain: first, that
Mr. Cooper's motives in his later political
course were thoroughly pure and unselfish;
and secondly, that his utterances and publications
in this connection show him to be
dealing with subjects which he did not understand.
This statement is made without
regard to the merits of the controversy, or
the strength of the arguments contributed
to it by others. The simple truth is that
Mr. Cooper was too old to make original
investigation of such questions, intelligently
weighing all the modern conditions of industry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and commerce, in which he was no longer
an active participant. He accepted in 1876
the nomination of the Greenback party for
the presidency; but the issue was already
practically dead, and he received but 81,740
votes out of a total of 8,412,833 cast. Undaunted
by this defeat, he continued to utter
his views. Those who wish to study them
in detail may consult the volume "Ideas for
a Science of Good Government in Addresses,
Letters, and Articles on a Strictly National
Currency, Tariff, and Civil Service," which
he issued at the age of ninety-two, in the
last year of his life. His own summary of
his position, given on page 212 of this book,
shows that he desired a national legal-tender
paper currency, irredeemable in coin, but
"interconvertible" with government bonds,
and regulated by law as to volume per capita;
a "discriminating" protective tariff, "helpful
to all the industries of the country, where
the raw material and the labor can be furnished
by our own people;" and a civil service
divorced from party politics, based on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
personal fitness, with tenure of office during
good behavior, moderate salaries, and pensions
for the aged and sick, and provision
for widows and orphans.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>THE END</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1874, at the age of eighty-three, Mr.
Cooper said at a reception given in his
honor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I was born, New York contained
27,000 inhabitants. The upper limits of the
city were at Chambers Street. Not a single
free school, either by day or night, existed.
General Washington had just entered upon
his first term as President of the United States,
the whole annual expenditures of which did not
exceed $2,500,000, being about sixty cents
per head of the population. Not a single
steam engine had yet been built or erected
on the American continent; and the people
were clad in homespun, and were characterized
by the simple virtues and habits which
are usually associated with that primitive
garb. I need not tell you what the country
now is, and what the habits and the garments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of its people now are, or that the
expenditure, per capita, of the general government
has increased fifteen-fold. But I
have witnessed and taken a deep interest in
every step of the marvellous development
and progress which have characterized this
century beyond all the centuries which have
gone before.</p>

<p>"Measured by the achievements of the
years I have seen, I am one of the oldest
men who have ever lived; but I do not feel
old, and I propose to give you the receipt
by which I have preserved my youth.</p>

<p>"I have always given a friendly welcome to
new ideas, and I have endeavored not to feel
too old to learn; and thus, though I stand
here with the snows of so many winters
upon my head, my faith in human nature,
my belief in the progress of man to a better
social condition, and especially my trust in
the ability of men to establish and maintain
self-government, are as fresh and as young
as when I began to travel the path of life.</p>

<p>"While I have always recognized that the
object of business is to make money in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
honorable manner, I have endeavored to
remember that the object of life is to do
good. Hence I have been ready to engage
in all new enterprises, and, without incurring
debt, to risk in their promotion the
means which I had acquired, provided they
seemed to me calculated to advance the general
good. This will account for my early
attempt to perfect the steam engine, for my
attempt to construct the first American
locomotive, for my connection with the telegraph
in a course of efforts to unite our
country with the European world, and for
my recent efforts to solve the problem of
economical steam navigation on the canals;
to all of which you have so kindly referred.
It happens to but few men to change the
current of human progress, as it did to Watt,
to Fulton, to Stephenson, and to Morse; but
most men may be ready to welcome laborers
to a new field of usefulness, and to clear the
road for their progress.</p>

<p>"This I have tried to do, as well in the
perfecting and execution of their ideas as in
making such provision as my means have permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for the proper education of the young
mechanics and citizens of my native city, in
order to fit them for the reception of new
ideas, social, mechanical, and scientific&mdash;hoping
thus to economize and expand the
intellectual as well as the physical forces,
and provide a larger fund for distribution
among the various classes which necessarily
make up the total of society. If our lives
shall be such that we shall receive the glad
welcome of 'Well done, good and faithful
servant,' we shall then know that we have
not lived in vain."</p>

<p>For nine years after this utterance he
continued the peaceful and happy life which
it describes. When the end came, it was
quiet and painless. Surrounded by his children
and grandchildren, and whispering
with almost his last breath the desire for an
increase of his bequest to that other well-beloved
child, the Cooper Union, he "fell on
sleep," April 4, 1883.</p>

<p>On the day of his funeral New York city
presented an almost unexampled spectacle.
All Soul's Unitarian Church, in which his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
body was deposited, early in the morning
was thronged with a mighty multitude, passing
in procession to look upon the beloved
face. Eighteen young men from the Cooper
Union surrounded it, as a guard of honor.
A body of 3500 students of that institution,
of both sexes, marched by, casting flowers
upon the coffin, and followed by delegations
from all the municipal and charitable organizations
of the city, and by uncounted multitudes,
whose relation to the beloved philanthropist
was not official or representative,
but simply personal.</p>

<p>The busiest streets of New York, through
which the funeral procession passed on its
way to Greenwood Cemetery, beyond the
East River, were closed to business and
hung in black. The flags on all public
buildings, and on the ships in the harbor,
were at half-mast. The bells of all churches
were tolled. The whole city mourned, as it
had not done since, eighty years before, the
funeral procession of George Washington
moved through its streets.</p>

<p>If we seek, without affectionate prejudice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to discover the cause of this universal grief,
affection, and admiration, we shall find, I
think, that it lies chiefly in two circumstances;
namely, the character of Peter
Cooper as a lover of his kind, and the opportunity
afforded him by his long life, not
only to prove that character, but to become
personally known to many thousands of
those whom he sought unselfishly to serve.
Few persons except military commanders
have such an opportunity. The philanthropists
who labor in secret, no matter with
what noble motive, and do not come face to
face with their beneficiaries, may win the
applause of posterity, but cannot expect to
receive the immediate and personal affection
of their contemporaries. Least of all do
posthumous gifts arouse this sentiment.
Peter Cooper, above all other claims to renown
and gratitude, identified himself with
his philanthropy, and was known where he
was loved.</p>

his own, Mr. Cooper dictated the following passage, which
is almost the last in his <i>Reminiscences:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not only do I think of my wife during my waking
moments; she often comes to me in my dreams, sometimes
once a week, sometimes once in two weeks, and
sometimes at longer intervals. It is one of the greatest
pleasures of my life that I can believe that she has been,

sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> A curious survival of this state of things is the Manhattan
Company, which secured from the legislature a
perpetual charter, so skillfully framed (by Aaron Burr)
that, although it grants much more extensive powers
than could now be obtained by a corporation, it cannot
be successfully assailed so long as the fundamental condition
is fulfilled,&mdash;namely, that the company shall be
prepared to furnish water at all times, on demand. It is
said that, in compliance with this requirement, a small
steam pump is kept continually running, in connection
with a short system of pipes, somewhere near the City
Hall, and that the company stands ready to furnish water
to any applicant&mdash;only, the charter does not fix the price
which it may exact! So far as I know, the only use now
made of the extensive powers granted by this famous
charter is the maintenance of the Manhattan Bank. A
few years ago, excavations in lower Broadway brought to
light bored logs, which were supposed to be relics of the
old "Manhattan" system.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Not all of this amount is represented in permanent
endowments, since large contributions to cover deficits in
annual income as compared with current expenses, or for
special repairs and alterations, do not appear under that
head. According to the balance-sheet of January 1, 1900,
the total assets consist of $1,075,428.62, the appraised
value of the building, furniture, and apparatus; and $947,021.39
in cash on hand or investments,&mdash;making a total
of $2,022,450.01. Of the invested sum $953,159.30 is in
"special endowments," of which the income only can be
expended. This fund comprises $200,000 from Peter
Cooper and $340,000 from the family of the late William
Cooper, his brother; the remainder is made up of smaller
gifts (the chief of which are a bequest of $30,000 from
Wilson G. Hunt, one of the original trustees, and $10,000
each from Mary Stuart, J. Pierpont Morgan, Morris K.
Jesup, and John E. Parsons), and one of $300,000 made in
December, 1899, by Andrew Carnegie. In addition to the
aggregate thus made up Hon. Edward Cooper, the son,
and Mr. Abram S. Hewitt, the son-in-law of Peter Cooper,
have undertaken to furnish a further income of $10,000
per annum; and finally, according to the 41st Annual
Report of the Trustees (May, 1900), the Cooper Union,
as residuary legatee under the will of the late John
Holstead, will ultimately receive between $200,000 and
$300,000.</p>
<p>These recent additions to the endowment of the institution
will enable the trustees to enlarge its usefulness
in many ways, and especially (being no longer dependent
for annual income upon rents) to utilize the whole of the
building for educational purposes. Yet the total endowment
will still be modest, as compared with that of many
similar institutions of later origin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> There may have been more than a mere sentimental
regret in his mind at that time; for his inventive intuition
had struck out half a century before an idea to
which the slow thought of his fellows had not yet attained,&mdash;the
plan of utilizing roofs for the purpose of
giving to all classes an ownership of free air and far distance
and boundless sky as complete as any landowner
could command by fencing off a mountain for his own
pleasure. As he looked down upon the vast wilderness
of roofs and thought of the multitude laboring beneath
them or trudging through the streets ("up one ca&ntilde;on
and down another," as old Jim Bridger the scout said in
St. Louis), ignorant of the upper sphere within reach, he
might well have felt that one part of his original scheme
would still be a physical and moral boon to the metropolis.
In fact the disappearance of the "vacant lots," so
numerous in his youth, and so freely available as informal
parks and playgrounds, had created new necessity
for air and space. Whether he consciously recalled the
hanging gardens of Babylon, or the flat roofs universally
utilized for social and domestic purposes in eastern and
southern countries, I do not know. At all events he had
seized upon a similar idea, and now&mdash;nearly a score of
years after his death&mdash;we are waking up to its value.
Even the Cooper Union building some day, after more
pressing needs of equipment shall have been satisfied,
may be crowned with its garden of rest and outlook.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Of the original board, Peter Cooper was the first to
pass away. Mr. Hunt and Mr. Tiemann have since died,
and Mr. R. Fulton Cutting has been elected a trustee.
